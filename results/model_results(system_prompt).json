The function takes a list of numerical values as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). To do that, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the provided list using NumPy's built-in functions (`np.mean()`) to get the central point.\n2. Iterate over each number in the list and compute the absolute deviation from the mean by subtracting the mean value from the current number and taking the absolute value.\n3. Sum up all the deviations obtained in step 2 and divide by the length of the list to obtain the final result.\n\nBy implementing the function according to these steps, you will be able to accurately calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of any given dataset."

Then, convert each word to its corresponding integer value by mapping it to an index based on its alphabetical order. Finally, create a list of tuples containing the integers and their original strings for sorting purposes. After that, sort the list of tuples based on the integers and extract the original strings back out as the output.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:\n    pattern = r'\\d+'\n\n    def num_to_index(num):\n        if num == 'zero':\n            return 0\n        elif num == 'one':\n            return 1\n        elif num == 'two':\n            return 2\n        elif num == 'three':\n            return 3\n        elif num == 'four':\n            return 4\n        elif num == 'five':\n            return 5\n        elif num == 'six':\n            return 6\n        elif num == 'seven':\n            return 7\n        elif num == 'eight':\n            return 8\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid number '{num}'\")\n\n    words = [word.strip() for word in re.findall(pattern, numbers)]\n    indices = [(num_to_index(word), int(word)) for word in words]\n    sorted_indices = sorted(indices)\n    result = ''.join([words[idx[1]] for idx in sorted_indices])\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation uses regular expressions to split the input string into individual words, converts each word to its corresponding integer value using `num_to_index`, creates a list of tuples containing the integers and their original strings, sorts the list of tuples based on the integers, extracts the original strings back out, and returns the final sorted string."
